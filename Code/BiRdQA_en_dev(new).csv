"Four members of a band are walking to a night concert. They decide to take a shortcut, but must cross a bridge. Luckily they have one flashlight. Because of the varying size of their instruments, it takes each member a different amount of time to cross the bridge - it takes the first person one minute, the second person two minutes, the third person five minutes and the fourth person ten minutes. They must cross the bridge in pairs, travelling at the slower speed so if the one minute person went with the ten minute person, it would take a total of ten minutes. Since there is only one flashlight, one person must come back across the bridge, then another pair can cross. They only have 17 minutes to cross the bridge and still get to the concert on time. What order should they cross to get everyone across and get to the concert?",first,second,babysitter,janitor,0

Man would welcome any opportunity to fit an unwelcome harness .on our first whilst it is in full gallop. Thus the first will conspire with our second to tackle the quest.To subdue the third to be a slave at your behest. Our second was so repulsive as to be banished forthwith.to the far-flung corners of the globe. His feet planted firmly on terra firma, On his pate, an insecure white cap.

As I get used to my life on land, With my new tenant and his band. I ask you all to think of me, And try to guess just what I be.",dream catcher,sea shell,flammable,flute,1
"I lie, abandoned,  on the beach. My watery home I cannot reach. My former owner set me free. He has no further need of me. I have no tenant, nor any friend. Is this how I am doomed to end? An empty, useless, lonely stray. Without the means to move or play. But wait!  I hear a strange, new sound. A creature moving across the ground. I sense him, as he checks me out. Looking for food, I have no doubt. But in another minute or less, This creature's purpose I can guess. He needs a home. A larger place. His need becomes my saving grace. So remember, when you are down and out. On a garbage heap, you have no doubt. Don't give up hope, for that's a sin. You may be in Nature's recycling bin. As I get used to my life on land, With my new tenant and his band. I ask you all to think of me, And try to guess just what I be.",sea shell,flammable,dream catcher,lightning,0
