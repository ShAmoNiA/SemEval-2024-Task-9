I only hurt you when I'm not taken care of, and then I may hurt the people you love. You see me every day and take me for granted. I come in all shapes and sizes and can even be painted. It's easy to get stains all over me. Some people actually like it once they see. I can be really heavy or light as a feather. And sometimes can't survive the harsh, wet weather. But most importantly of all I keep you safe and dry. As long as I am taken care of properly I won't die. I can live for a long time - outlive even you. Even after I'm dead that's one of the many things I can do. People use me when I'm alive and use me when I'm dead. And use me when they are alive and when they are dead too. I come in handy with all kinds of neat stuff. But you can burn me badly with one single puff. What Am I?",drywall,concrete,wood,steel,2
