1 duck saw 4 elephants as it was going toward the river.Every elephant noticed 2 monkeys going to the river.Every monkey was carrying 1 dove in its paws.How many animals are going to the river?,"Five animals are moving toward the river.Here's a detailed answer:1 duck noticed 4 elephants as it was going toward the river. Hence, 1 animal (the duck) is moving to the river.The 4 elephants saw 2 monkeys going walking toward the river. Now comes the tricky part. You may think that each elephant saw 2 different monkeys walking toward the river. So you would conclude that 4 x 2 = 8 monkeys were going to the river.However, the task does not explicitly say that each elephant saw DIFFERENT monkeys. In fact, you can logically infer that the elephants saw the SAME 2 monkeys. Hence, we only have 2 additional animals (monkeys) moving toward the river.Since every monkey was carrying 1 dove, the 2 monkeys were carrying 2 doves in total.Summing up, we have 1 duck, 2 monkeys, and 2 doves moving to the river. 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 animals."
