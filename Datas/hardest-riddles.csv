Each pirate is smart, greedy, and wants to throw as many others overboard as possible without reducing the amount of gold they get.What plan can the first (oldest) pirate propose to live and get as much gold as possible?","He can propose a plan that he gets 98 pieces of gold, the 3rd pirate gets 1 piece, and the 5th pirate gets 1 as well.If there were just 2 pirates the younger pirate would definitely deny the plan so he could get all of the gold.If there were 3 pirates the first pirate can offer the second pirate 1 piece of gold and take the rest himself because the second pirate wouldn't get anything if he has to propose a plan himself.If there were 4 pirates the first pirate could take 99 for himself and offer 1 to the youngest pirate. They would both agree. If the youngest disagrees then he won't get any gold in the next plan.So when there are 5 pirates it is in the interest of the 3rd and 5th pirate to accept 1 piece, because if they don't they won't get anything in the next plan."

"A man has three daughters. A second, intelligent man, asked him the ages of his daughters. The first man told him that the product of their ages (them all multiplied together,) was 36. After thinking the second man was unable to find the answer and asked for another clue. The first man replies the sum of their ages is equal to his house door number. Still the second man was unable to answer and asked for another clue. The first man told him that his youngest daughter had blue eyes, and suddenly second man gave the correct answer. What were the ages of the first man's 3 children?","The ages are 6, 6 and 1.to solve, you want to write down all the 3 numbers whose product is 36.1, 1, 361, 3, 121, 4, 91, 2, 181, 6, 62, 2, 92, 3, 63, 3, 4Here's the hardest part, the fact that the doorbell clue was not enough to solve the puzzle means that if we add up each of these options, we get at least two results that are the same, and we need more information to decide which one.These are13: 1, 6, 613: 2, 2, 9Then to find the last hint, knowing that there IS a youngest child, means the smallest child doesn't have another sibling in the same age, meaning that 2,2,9 doesn't work, and we are left with 1, 6 and 6."
